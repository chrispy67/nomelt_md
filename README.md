_A learnable transition from low temperature to high temperature proteins with neural machine translation_

- All simulations were performed using GROMACS 2022.5 compiled on The University of Washington Hyak computer cluster. 
- The structures provided are solvated and energy-minimized.
- Generic `.mdp` files used to simulate all replicas for every protein.
- `rmsd.py` is an example script that calculates the RMSD of an ensemble of protein structures at different temperatures
